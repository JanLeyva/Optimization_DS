# Support Vector Machine from scratch

The aim of this project is go deeper with svm doing it as optimization problem. For this is used the solver  `cvxpy`.

We goingo to see 3 steps for SVM

1. When classes are linearly separable, maximize the margin between the two classes
1. When classes are not linearly separable, maximize the margin but allow some samples within the margin. That is the soft margin
1. The Kernel trick to extend the separation to non linear frontieres
