## Cluster Median

This project is a comparison of the performance in terms of the optimal solution and time of three different models to cluster three different data sets. The aim of this project is to see the difference between an optimal model and a heuristic one. To do that, the optimal-solution algorithm used is a Cluster-Median, and the two heuristic ones are a Minimum Spanning Tree and a K-Means.
